        <h3>Climate Change Analysis</h3>
        <p>Climate change impacts us all. Industries are now including Sustainability as a core value of their visions and using data analytics to drive meaningful decision making towards a greener future
            This project provides an example of how machine learning can be used as a tool to predict future warming trends and the impact of them on our world
            
            Objectives
            
            1.	Data Preparation: Importing, and preprocessing the temperature change dataset, including handling missing values and transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis.
            2.	Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing the temperature change data for different countries and identifying any underlying patterns or trends.
            3.	Model Training: Splitting the data into training and testing sets, and training regression models such as linear regression and polynomial regression on the training data.
            4.	Future Temperature Prediction: Using the trained models to make predictions on future temperature changes by generating artificial data for the future years.
            5.	Visualization: Plotting the average temperature change for each country, the overall average temperature change, and the predictions from the trained regression models to visualize the trends and compare the models’ performance

        <h3>Anti-Microbial Resistance</h3>
        <p>The aim of this project is to visualize patterns and tends in AMR across different parts of the world as published in Charani et. al. 
            Showing via interactive charts which region is the most impacted by resistance to each antibiotic class, what health spending looks like in each region, and whether the AMR burden correlates to the amount spent on healthcare in a given region. The aim is to examine the following questions:

            Which Pathogens, Antibiotic Classes and Infectious syndromes are associated with death?
            Which regions of the world are most at risk and why?
            Does the amount of healthcare spending affect the risk of the population to AMR’s?</p>
